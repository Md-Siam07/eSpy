**Description:**
**eSpy is** a project designed to track and analyze user behavior on a computer system while ensuring complete anonymity. The system operates discreetly in the background, capturing various aspects of the user's activity for analysis and reporting purposes. It provides valuable insights into the user's browsing habits, including the websites visited, while respecting privacy and legal considerations.

**Key Features:**
**1. Keystroke Logging:** The system discreetly records the keystrokes made by the user, allowing for the extraction of useful information such as typed URLs, search queries, and other textual input. This data is compiled in a compact format for further analysis.

**2. Screenshot Capture:** At regular intervals (e.g., every 15 minutes), the system captures screenshots of the user's screen. These screenshots provide visual context and can assist in understanding the user's activities and interactions with different applications or websites.

**3. Data Parsing:** The logged keystrokes and captured screenshots are processed and analyzed to extract relevant information. Specifically, the system parses the data to identify the websites visited by the user, providing insights into their online behavior and interests.

**4. Reporting and Email Notifications:** The system sends periodic email notifications, typically every 2 hours, containing a summary of the user's activities. The email includes the compact result of keystrokes, listing the visited websites, and any other relevant details. Additionally, an admin panel allows manual email sending for more flexibility.

**5. Window Tracking:** The system also monitors the windows the user interacts with, capturing information about which applications or windows they click on. This feature provides a comprehensive overview of the user's software usage patterns.

**6. Authentication and Admin Surveillance Support:** The system incorporates authentication mechanisms to ensure that only authorized individuals can access the admin panel. By using a specific key combination (e.g., CTRL+SHIFT+TAB), the admin panel is launched, enabling supervised monitoring and control over the system's operations.

It's **important** to note that the project aims to adhere to ethical guidelines and legal boundaries. Respect for privacy and consent is paramount, and users should be made aware of the system's presence and obtain their consent for monitoring activities.

Please ensure that the project is conducted with proper permissions and in compliance with applicable laws and regulations to protect individuals' rights and privacy.
